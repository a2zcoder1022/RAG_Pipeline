# RAG_Pipeline
This project aims to build a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the CORD-19 dataset. The goal is to provide an end-to-end framework that demonstrates the key components involved in constructing a RAG system. The pipeline will be broken down into the following major components:

Vector Database: We will use Pinecone to store and retrieve vectorized representations of the data.
Embeddings: The embeddings will be generated using a pre-trained BERT or GPT model.
Similarity Metric: Cosine similarity will be utilized to measure the closeness of embeddings.
Large Language Model (LLM): We will integrate OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT for generating responses based on retrieved information.
This structure ensures an efficient combination of retrieval and generation, demonstrating the core principles of a RAG pipeline.
